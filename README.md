# Face-Mask-Detection-
A Real-time face mask detection system using webcam and static image uploads. Detects if a person is wearing a mask or not, provides voice alerts, sends WhatsApp image alerts for violations, logs geotagged incidents, displays a heatmap of locations, and generates a compliance report of mask violations and adherence.
